# Building a CNN in PyTorch


I've been using TensorFlow/Keras since I started working with deep learning, so now I've decided to learn a new tool: PyTorch. Considering what I've been learning in the Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch course by IBM (https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch), I developed a convolutional neural network for MNIST classification using a ModuleList so that I can test various layers configurations without any need for changes in the model class.
